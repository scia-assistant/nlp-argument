 This is a guide to using logical fallacies in debate. And when I say "using,"
I don't mean just pointing them out when opposing debaters commit them
-- I mean deliberately committing them oneself, or finding ways to transform
fallacious arguments into perfectly good ones.
 <p>
  Debate is, fortunately or not, an exercise in persuasion, wit, and rhetoric,
not just logic. In a debate format that limits each debater's speaking
time, it is simply not reasonable to expect every proposition or conclusion
to follow precisely and rigorously from a clear set of premises stated
at the outset. Instead, debaters have to bring together various facts,
insights, and values that others share or can be persuaded to accept, and
then show that those ideas lead more or less plausibly to a conclusion.
Logic is a useful tool in this process, but it is not the only tool --
after all, "plausibility" is a fairly subjective matter that does not follow
strict logical rules. Ultimately, the judge in a debate round has to decide
which side's position is more plausible in light of the arguments given
-- and the judge is required to pick one of those sides, even if logic
alone dictates that "we do not know" is the answer to the question at hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  Besides, let's be honest: debate is not just about finding truth, it's
also about
  <i>
   winning.
  </i>
  If you think a fallacious argument can slide
by and persuade the judge to vote for you, you're going to make it, right?
The trick is not getting caught.
  <br/>

     So why learn

   </b>
  </h2>
 </center>
 I can think of a couple of good reasons. First, it makes you look smart.
If you can not only show that the opposition has made an error in reasoning,
but you can give that error a name as well (in Latin!), it shows that you
can think on your feet and that you understand the opposition's argument
possibly better than they do.
 <p>
  Second, and maybe more importantly, pointing out a logical fallacy is
a way of
  <i>
   removing an argument from the debate
  </i>
  rather than just weakening
it. Much of the time, a debater will respond to an argument by simply stating
a counterargument showing why the original argument is not terribly significant
in comparison to other concerns, or shouldn't be taken seriously, or whatever.
That kind of response is fine, except that the original argument still
remains in the debate, albeit in a less persuasive form, and the opposition
is free to mount a rhetorical offensive saying why it's important after
all. On the other hand, if you can show that the original argument actually
commits a logical fallacy, you put the opposition in the position of justifying
why their original argument should be considered
  <i>
   at all
  </i>
  . If they
can't come up with a darn good reason, then the argument is actually removed
from the round.

 Unfortunately, the account I have just given is a bit idealized. Not every
judge will immediately recognize the importance of the logical fallacy
you've pointed out in your opposition's argument. Even if a logician would
immediately accept the accuracy of your point, in a debate round it's the
judge that counts.
 <p>
  It is therefore not enough simply to point out a logical fallacy and
move on; there is an art to pointing out logical fallacies in your opposition's
arguments. Here are a few strategies I've found useful in pointing out
logical fallacies in an effective manner:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   State the name of the logical fallacy, preferably in both Latin and English,
and make sure you use the phrase "logical fallacy." Why? Because it is
important to impress on everyone that this is no mere counterargument you
are making, nor are you just labelling the opposition's viewpoint as "fallacious"
for rhetorical effect. Stating the fallacy's Latin name helps, because
some people just aren't sure something's a fallacy unless Aristotle or
some other authority called it one. Say something like, "The opposition
points out that the voters supported X by a wide margin in last year's
referendum. But this is just the logical fallacy of
   <i>
    <a href="http://www.csun.edu/%7Edgw61315/fallacies.html#Argumentum%20ad%20populum">
     argumentum
ad populum
    </a>
   </i>
   , appeal to public opinion!"
  </li>
  <li>
   Tell everybody what the fallacy means and why it is wrong. But be careful
-- you have to do this without sounding pedantic. You should state the
fallacy's meaning as though you are reiterating what you assume your intelligent
judge already knows. To continue the example above, say, "It doesn't matter
how many people agree with you, that doesn't mean it's necessarily
   <i>
    right
   </i>
   ."
There, now you've defined for everyone what's fallacious about
   <i>
    argumentum
ad populum.
   </i>
  </li>
  <li>
   Give a really obvious example of why the fallacy is incorrect. Preferably,
the example should also be an unfavorable analogy for the opposition's
proposal. Thus: "Last century, the majority of people in some states thought
slavery was acceptable, but that didn't make it so!"
  </li>
  <li>
   Finally, point out why the logical fallacy matters to the debate round.
"This fallacious argument should be thrown out of the debate. And that
means that the opposition's only remaining argument for X is...."
  </li>
 </ul>
 <center>
  <h2>

  </h2>
 </center>
 In general, of course, it's a good idea to avoid logical fallacies if at
all possible, because a good debater will almost always catch you. It is
especially important to avoid obvious logical fallacies like the one above
(
 <i>
  argumentum ad populum
 </i>
 ), because they are vulnerable to such powerful
(and persuasive) refutations. But sometimes, a logical fallacy -- or at
least an unjustified logical leap -- is unavoidable. And there are some
types of argument that are listed as logical fallacies in logic textbooks,
but that are perfectly acceptable in the context of the rules of debate.
The most important guideline for committing such fallacies yourself is
to
 <i>
  know when you are doing it
 </i>
 , and to be prepared to justify yourself
later if the opposition tries to call you down for it. For examples of
logical fallacies that can sometimes be acceptable in the context of debate,

 What follows is not a comprehensive list of all the known logical fallacies.
Nor is this intended as a rigorous philosophical treatise on logical reasoning.
(If that's what you're looking for, you should check out the following
excellent web resources:
 <a href="http://www.infidels.org/news/atheism/logic.html">
  The
Atheist Web's logic page
 </a>
 , or
 <a href="http://www.sjsu/depts/itl/graphics/main.html">
  San
Jose University's Mission: Critical page
 </a>
 ; I owe a debt to these pages
for reminding me of a number of fallacies I had forgotten about.) What
I have done is compile a list of fallacies that debaters should be familiar
with -- either for pointing them out in others' arguments or for using
and defending them in one's own.
 <p>
  <a name="Argumentum ad antiquitatem">
  </a>
  <b>
   <i>
    Argumentum ad antiquitatem
   </i>
   (the argument to antiquity or tradition).
  </b>
  This is the familiar
argument that some policy, behavior, or practice is right or acceptable
because "it's always been done that way." This is an extremely popular
fallacy in debate rounds; for example, "Every great civilization in history
has provided state subsidies for art and culture!" But that fact does not
justify continuing the policy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Because an
  <i>
   argumentum ad antiquitatem
  </i>
  is easily refuted by simply
pointing it out, in general it should be avoided. But if you must make
such an argument -- perhaps because you can't come up with anything better
-- you can at least make it marginally more acceptable by providing some
reason why tradition should usually be respected. For instance, you might
make an evolutionary argument to the effect that the prevalence of a particular
practice in existing societies is evidence that societies that failed to
adopt it were weeded out by natural selection. This argument is weak, but
better than the fallacy alone.
 </p>
 <p>
  <a name="Argumentum ad hominem">
  </a>
  <b>
   <i>
    Argumentum ad hominem
   </i>
   (argument
directed at the person).
  </b>
  This is the error of attacking the character
or motives of a person who has stated an idea, rather than the idea itself.
The most obvious example of this fallacy is when one debater maligns the
character of another debater (e.g, "The members of the opposition are a
couple of fascists!"), but this is actually not that common. A more typical
manifestation of
  <i>
   argumentum ad hominem
  </i>
  is attacking a source of
information -- for example, responding to a quotation from Richard Nixon
on the subject of free trade with China by saying, "We all know Nixon was
a liar and a cheat, so why should we believe anything he says?"
  <i>
   Argumentum
ad hominem
  </i>
  also occurs when someone's arguments are discounted merely
because they stand to benefit from the policy they advocate -- such as
Bill Gates arguing against antitrust, rich people arguing for lower taxes,
white people arguing against affirmative action, minorities arguing for
affirmative action, etc. In all of these cases, the relevant question is
not who makes the argument, but whether the argument is valid.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is always bad form to use the fallacy of
  <i>
   argumentum ad hominem
  </i>
  .
But there are some cases when it is not really a fallacy, such as when
one needs to evaluate the truth of factual statements (as opposed to lines
of argument or statements of value) made by interested parties. If someone
has an
  <i>
   incentive to lie
  </i>
  about something, then it would be naive
to accept his statements about that subject without question. It is also
possible to restate many
  <i>
   ad hominem
  </i>
  arguments so as to redirect
them toward ideas rather than people, such as by replacing "My opponents
are fascists" with "My opponents' arguments are fascist."
 </p>
 <p>
  <a name="Argumentum ad ignorantiam">
  </a>
  <b>
   <i>
    Argumentum ad ignorantiam
   </i>
   (argument to ignorance).
  </b>
  This is the fallacy of assuming something
is true simply because it hasn't been proven false. For example, someone
might argue that global warming is certainly occurring because nobody has
demonstrated conclusively that it is not. But failing to prove the global
warming theory false is not the same as proving it true.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether or not an
  <i>
   argumentum ad ignorantiam
  </i>
  is really fallacious
depends crucially upon the burden of proof. In an American courtroom, where
the burden of proof rests with the prosecution, it would be fallacious
for the prosecution to argue, "The defendant has no alibi, therefore he
must have committed the crime." But it would be perfectly valid for the
defense to argue, "The prosecution has not proven the defendant committed
the crime, therefore you should declare him not guilty." Both statements
have the form of an
  <i>
   argumentum ad ignorantiam
  </i>
  ; the difference is
the burden of proof.
 </p>
 <p>
  In debate, the proposing team in a debate round is usually (but not
always) assumed to have the burden of proof, which means that if the team
fails to prove the proposition to the satisfaction of the judge, the opposition
wins. In a sense, the opposition team's case is assumed true until proven
false. But the burden of proof can sometimes be shifted; for example, in
some forms of debate, the proposing team can shift the burden of proof
to the opposing team by presenting a
  <i>
   prima facie
  </i>
  case that would,
in the absence of refutation, be sufficient to affirm the proposition.
Still, the higher burden generally rests with the proposing team, which
means that only the opposition is in a position to make an accusation of
  <i>
   argumentum ad ignorantiam
  </i>
  with respect to proving the proposition.
 </p>
 <p>
  <a name="Argumentum ad logicam">
  </a>
  <b>
   <i>
    Argumentum ad logicam
   </i>
   (argument
to logic).
  </b>
  This is the fallacy of assuming that something is false
simply because a proof or argument that someone has offered for it is invalid;
this reasoning is fallacious because there may be another proof or argument
that successfully supports the proposition. This fallacy often appears
in the context of a
  <a href="http://www.csun.edu/%7Edgw61315/fallacies.html#Straw%20man">
   straw
man
  </a>
  argument.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is another case in which the burden of proof determines whether
it is actually a fallacy or not. If a proposing team fails to provide sufficient
support for its case, the burden of proof dictates they should lose the
debate, even if there exist other arguments (not presented by the proposing
team) that could have supported the case successfully. Moreover, it is
common practice in debate for judges to give no weight to a point supported
by an argument that has been proven invalid by the other team, even if
there might be a valid argument the team failed to make that would have
supported the same point; this is because the implicit burden of proof
rests with the team that brought up the argument. For further commentary
on burdens of proof, see
  <i>
   <a href="http://www.csun.edu/%7Edgw61315/fallacies.html#Argumentum%20ad%20ignorantium">
    argumentum
ad ignorantiam
   </a>
  </i>
  , above.
 </p>
 <p>
  <a name="Argumentum ad misericordiam">
  </a>
  <b>
   <i>
    Argumentum ad misericordiam
   </i>
   (argument or appeal to pity).
  </b>
  The English translation pretty much says
it all. Example: "Think of all the poor, starving Ethiopian children! How
could we be so cruel as not to help them?" The problem with such an argument
is that no amount of special pleading can make the impossible possible,
the false true, the expensive costless, etc.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is, of course, perfectly legitimate to point out the severity of
a problem as part of the justification for adopting a proposed solution.
The fallacy comes in when other aspects of the proposed solution (such
as whether it is possible, how much it costs, who else might be harmed
by adopting the policy) are ignored or responded to only with more impassioned
pleas. You should not call your opposition down for committing this fallacy
unless they rely on appeals to pity to the exclusion of the other necessary
arguments. It is perfectly acceptable to use appeal to pity in order to
argue that the benefits of the proposed policy are greater than they might
at first appear (and hence capable of justifying larger costs).
 </p>
 <p>
  <a name="Argumentum ad nauseam">
  </a>
  <b>
   <i>
    Argumentum ad nauseam
   </i>
   (argument
to the point of disgust; i.e., by repitition).
  </b>
  This is the fallacy
of trying to prove something by saying it again and again. But no matter
how many times you repeat something, it will not become any more or less
true than it was in the first place. Of course, it is not a fallacy to
state the truth again and again; what is fallacious is to expect the repitition
alone to substitute for real arguments.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nonetheless, this is a very popular fallacy in debate, and with good
reason: the more times you say something, the more likely it is that the
judge will remember it. The first thing they'll teach you in any public
speaking course is that you should "Tell 'em what you're gonna tell 'em,
then tell 'em, and then tell 'em what you told 'em." Unfortunately, some
debaters think that's all there is to it, with no substantiation necessary!
The appropriate time to mention
  <i>
   argumentum ad nauseam
  </i>
  in a debate
round is when the other team has made some assertion, failed to justify
it, and then stated it again and again. The Latin wording is particularly
nice here, since it is evocative of what the opposition's assertions make
you want to do: retch. "Sir, our opponents tell us
  <i>
   drugs are wrong
  </i>
  ,
  <i>
   drugs are wrong
  </i>
  ,
  <i>
   drugs are wrong
  </i>
  , again and again and again.
But this
  <i>
   argumentum ad nauseam
  </i>
  can't and won't win this debate for
them, because they've given us no justification for their bald assertions!"

  This fallacy is the attempt to prove
something by showing how many people think that it's true. But no matter
how many people believe something, that doesn't necessarily make it true
or right. Example: "At least 70% of all Americans support restrictions
on access to abortions." Well, maybe 70% of Americans are wrong!
 </p>
 <p>
  This fallacy is very similar to

  , the appeal to the people or to popularity. When a distinction
is made between the two,
  <i>
   ad populum
  </i>
  is construed narrowly to designate
an appeal to the opinions of people in the immediate vicinity, perhaps
in hope of getting others (such as judges) to jump on the bandwagon, whereas
  <i>
   ad numerum
  </i>
  is used to designate appeals based purely on the number
of people who hold a particular belief. The distinction is a fine one,
and in general the terms can be used interchangeably in debate rounds.
(I've found that
  <i>

  </i>
  has better rhetorical effect.)

  <b>
   <i>
    Argumentum ad verecundiam
   </i>
   (argument or appeal to authority).
  </b>
  This fallacy occurs when someone
tries to demonstrate the truth of a proposition by citing some person who
agrees, even though that person may have no expertise in the given area.
For instance, some people like to quote Einstein's opinions about politics
(he tended to have fairly left-wing views), as though Einstein were a political
philosopher rather than a physicist. Of course, it is not a fallacy at
all to rely on authorities whose expertise relates to the question at hand,
especially with regard to questions of fact that could not easily be answered
by a layman -- for instance, it makes perfect sense to quote Stephen Hawking
on the subject of black holes.
 </p>
 <p>
  At least in some forms of debate, quoting various sources to support
one's position is not just acceptable but mandatory. In general, there
is nothing wrong with doing so. Even if the person quoted has no particular
expertise in the area, he may have had a particularly eloquent way of saying
something that makes for a more persuasive speech. In general, debaters
should be called down for committing
  <i>
   argumentum ad verecundiam
  </i>
  only
when (a) they rely on an unqualified source for information about facts
without other (qualified) sources of verification, or (b) they imply that
some policy must be right simply because so-and-so thought so.

 <p>
  <a name="Circulus in demonstrando">
  </a>
  <b>
   <i>
    Circulus in demonstrando
   </i>
   (circular argument).
  </b>
  Circular argumentation occurs when someone
uses what they are trying to prove as part of the proof of that thing.
Here is one of my favorite examples (in pared down form): "Marijuana is
illegal in every state in the nation. And we all know that you shouldn't
violate the law. Since smoking pot is illegal, you shouldn't smoke pot.
And since you shouldn't smoke pot, it is the duty of the government to
stop people from smoking it, which is why marijuana is illegal!"
 </p>
 <p>
  Circular arguments appear a lot in debate, but they are not always so
easy to spot as the example above. They are always illegitimate, though,
and pointing them out in a debate round looks really good if you can do
it. The best strategy for pointing out a circular argument is to make sure
you can state clearly the proposition being proven, and then pinpoint where
that proposition appears in the proof. A good summing up statement is,
"In other words, they are trying to tell us that X is true because X is
true! But they have yet to tell us
  <i>
   why
  </i>
  it's true."
 </p>
 <p>
  <a name="Complex question">
  </a>
  <b>
   Complex question.
  </b>
  A complex question
is a question that implicitly assumes something to be true by its construction,
such as "Have you stopped beating your wife?" A question like this is fallacious
only if the thing presumed true (in this case, that you beat your wife)
has not been established.
 </p>
 <p>
  Complex questions are a well established and time-honored practice in
debate, although they are rarely so bald-faced as the example just given.
Complex questions usually appear in cross-examination or points of information
when the questioner wants the questionee to inadvertently admit something
that she might not admit if asked directly. For instance, one might say,
"Inasmuch as the majority of black Americans live in poverty, do you really
think that self-help within the black community is sufficient to address
their problems?" Of course, the introductory clause about the majority
of black Americans living in poverty may not be true (in fact, it is false),
but an unwary debater might not think quickly enough to notice that the
stowaway statement is questionable. This is a sneaky tactic, but debate
is sometimes a sneaky business. You wouldn't want to put a question like
that in your master's thesis, but it might work in a debate. But be careful
-- if you try to pull a fast one on someone who is alert enough to catch
you, you'll look stupid. "The assumption behind your question is simply
false. The majority of blacks do
  <i>
   not
  </i>
  live in poverty. Get your facts
straight before you interrupt me again!"

 <p>
  <a name="Cum hoc ergo propter hoc">

  <b>
   <i>
    Cum hoc ergo propter hoc
   </i>
   (with this, therefore because of this).
  </b>
  This is the familiar fallacy
of mistaking correlation for causation -- i.e., thinking that because two
things occur simultaneously, one must be a cause of the other. A popular
example of this fallacy is the argument that "President Clinton has great
economic policies; just look at how well the economy is doing while he's
in office!" The problem here is that two things may happen at the same
time merely by coincidence (e.g., the President may have a negligible effect
on the economy, and the real driving force is technological growth), or
the causative link between one thing and another may be lagged in time
(e.g., the current economy's health is determined by the actions of previous
presidents), or the two things may be unconnected to each other but related
to a common cause (e.g., downsizing upset a lot of voters, causing them
to elect a new president just before the economy began to benefit from
the downsizing).
 </p>
 <p>
  It is always fallacious to suppose that there is a causative link between
two things simply because they coexist. But a correlation is usually considered
acceptable supporting evidence for
  <i>
   theories
  </i>
  that argue for a causative
link between two things. For instance, some economic theories suggest that
substantially reducing the federal budget deficit should cause the economy
to do better (loosely speaking), so the coincidence of deficit reductions
under Clinton and the economy's relative health might be taken as evidence
in favor of those economic theories. In debate rounds, what this means
is that it is acceptable to demonstrate a correlation between two phenomenon
and to say one caused the other
  <i>
   if
  </i>
  you can also come up with convincing
reasons why the correlation is no accident.
 </p>
 <p>
  <i>

   <i>
    Dicto simpliciter
   </i>
   (spoken
simply, i.e., sweeping generalization).
  </b>
  This is the fallacy of making
a sweeping statement and expecting it to be true of every specific case
-- in other words, stereotyping. Example: "Women are on average not as
strong as men and less able to carry a gun. Therefore women can't pull
their weight in a military unit." The problem is that the sweeping statement
may be true (on average, women are indeed weaker than men), but it is not
necessarily true for every member of the group in question (there are some
women who are much stronger than the average).
 </p>
 <p>
  As the example indicates,
  <i>
   dicto simpliciter
  </i>
  is fairly common
in debate rounds. Most of the time, it is not necessary to call an opposing
debater down for making this fallacy -- it is enough to point out why the
sweeping generalization they have made fails to prove their point. Since
everybody knows what a sweeping generalization is, using the Latin in this
case will usually sound condescending. It is also important to note that
some generalizations are perfectly valid and apply directly to all individual
cases, and therefore do not commit the fallacy of
  <i>
   dicto simpliciter
  </i>
  (for example, "All human males have a Y chromosome" is, to my knowledge,
absolutely correct).
 </p>
 <p>
  <a name="Nature, appeal to">
  </a>
  <b>
   Nature, appeal to.
  </b>
  This is the
fallacy of assuming that whatever is "natural" or consistent with "nature"
(somehow defined) is good, or that whatever conflicts with nature is bad.
For example, "Sodomy is unnatural; anal sex is not the evolutionary function
of a penis or an anus. Therefore sodomy is wrong." But aside from the difficulty
of defining what "natural" even means, there is no particular reason to
suppose that unnatural and wrong are the same thing. After all, wearing
clothes, tilling the soil, and using fire might be considered unnatural
since no other animals do so, but humans do these things all the time and
to great benefit.
 </p>
 <p>
  The appeal to nature appears occasionally in debate, often in the form
of naive environmentalist arguments for preserving pristine wilderness
or resources. The argument is very weak and should always be shot down.
It can, however, be made stronger by showing why at least in specific cases,
there may be a (possibly unspecifiable) benefit to preserving nature as
it is. A typical ecological argument along these lines is that human beings
are part of a complex biological system that is highly sensitive to shocks,
and therefore it is dangerous for humans to engage in activities that might
damage the system in ways we cannot predict. Note, however, that this approach
no longer appeals to nature itself, but to the value of human survival.

  <b>
   Naturalistic fallacy.
  </b>
  This
is the fallacy of trying to derive conclusions about what is right or good
(that is, about values) from statements of fact alone. This is invalid
because no matter how many statements of fact you assemble, any logical
inference from them will be another statement of fact, not a statement
of value. If you wish to reach conclusions about values, then you must
include amongst your assumptions (or axioms, or premises) a statement of
value. Once you have an axiomatic statement of value, then you may use
it in conjunction with statements of fact to reach value-laden conclusions.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example, someone might argue that the premise, "This medicine will
prevent you from dying" immediately leads to the conclusion, "You should
take this medicine." But this reasoning is invalid, because the former
statement is a statement of fact, while the latter is a statement of value.
To reach the conclusion that you ought to take the medicine, you would
need at least one more premise: "You ought to try to preserve your life
whenever possible."
 </p>
 <p>
  The naturalistic fallacy appears in many forms. Two examples are
  <i>
   <a href="http://www.csun.edu/%7Edgw61315/fallacies.html#Argumentum%20ad%20antiquitatem">
    argumentum
ad antiquitatem
   </a>
  </i>
  (saying something's right because it's always been
done that way) and the
  <a href="http://www.csun.edu/%7Edgw61315/fallacies.html#Nature,%20appeal%20to">
   appeal
to nature
  </a>
  (saying something's right because it's natural). In both
of these fallacies, the speaker is trying to reach a conclusion about what
we
  <i>
   ought
  </i>
  to do or
  <i>
   ought
  </i>
  to value based solely on what
  <i>
   is
  </i>
  the case. David Hume called this trying to bridge the "is-ought gap," which
is a nice phrase to use in debate rounds where your opponent is committing
the naturalistic fallacy.
 </p>
 <p>
  One unsettling implication of taking the naturalistic fallacy seriously
is that, in order to reach
  <i>
   any
  </i>
  conclusions of value, one must be
willing to posit some initial statement or statements of value that will
be treated as axioms, and which cannot themselves be justified on purely
logical grounds. Fortunately, debate does not restrict itself to purely
logical grounds of argumentation. For example, suppose your opponent has
stated axiomatically that "whatever is natural is good." Inasmuch as this
statement is an axiom rather than the conclusion of a logical proof, there
can be no purely logical argument against it. But some nonetheless appropriate
responses to such an absolute statement of value include: (a) questioning
whether anyone -- you, your judge, or even your opponent himself --
  <i>
   really
  </i>
  believes that "whatever is natural is good"; (b) stating a competing axiomatic
value statement, like "whatever enhances human life is good," and forcing
the judge to choose between them; and (c) pointing out logical implications
of the statement "whatever is natural is good" that conflict with our most
basic intuitions about right and wrong.
 </p>
 <p>
  <a name="Non sequitur">
  </a>
  <b>
   <i>
    Non Sequitur
   </i>
   ("It does not follow").
  </b>
  This is the simple fallacy of stating, as a conclusion, something that
does not strictly follow from the premises. For example, "Racism is wrong.
Therefore, we need affirmative action." Obviously, there is at least one
missing step in this argument, because the wrongness of racism does not
imply a need for affirmative action without some additional support (such
as, "Racism is common," "Affirmative action would reduce racism," "There
are no superior alternatives to affirmative action," etc.).
 </p>
 <p>
  Not surprisingly, debate rounds are rife with
  <i>
   non sequitur
  </i>
  . But
that is partly just a result of having to work within the time constraints
of a debate round, and partly a result of using good strategy. A debate
team arguing for affirmative action would be foolish to say in their first
speech, "We also believe that affirmative action does not lead to a racist
backlash," because doing so might give the other side a hint about a good
argument to make. A better strategy (usually) is to wait for the other
team to bring up an argument, and
  <i>
   then
  </i>
  refute it; that way, you
don't end up wasting your time by refuting arguments that the opposition
has never made in the first place. (This strategy is not always preferable,
though, because some counterarguments are so obvious and important that
it makes sense to address them early and nip them in the bud.)
 </p>
 <p>
  For these reasons, it is generally bad form to scream "non sequitur"
just because your opposition has failed to anticipate every counterargument
you might make. The best time to point out a
  <i>
   non sequitur
  </i>
  is when
your opposition is trying to construct a chain of causation (A leads to
B leads to C, etc.) without justifying each step in the chain. For each
step in the chain they fail to justify, point out the
  <i>
   non sequitur
  </i>
  ,
so that it is obvious by the end that the alleged chain of causation is
tenuous and implausible.

  <a name="Petitio principii">

   <i>

  This is the fallacy of assuming, when trying to prove
something, what it is that you are trying prove. For all practical purposes,
this fallacy is indistinguishable from

   circular
argumentation
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  The main thing to remember about this fallacy is that the term "begging
the question" has a very specific meaning. It is common to hear debaters
saying things like, "They say pornography should be legal because it is
a form of free expression. But this begs the question of what free expression
means." This is a misuse of terminology. Something may
  <i>
   inspire
  </i>
  or
  <i>
   motivate
  </i>
  us to ask a particular question without
  <i>
   begging
  </i>
  the question. A question has been begged only if the question has been
asked before in the same discussion, and then a conclusion is reached on
a related matter without the question having been answered. If somebody
said, "The fact that we believe pornography should be legal means that
it is a valid form of free expression. And since it's free expression,
it shouldn't be banned,"
  <i>
   that
  </i>
  would be begging the question.

 <p>
  <a name="Post hoc ergo propter hoc">

  <b>
   <i>
    Post hoc ergo propter
hoc
   </i>
   (after this, therefore because of this).
  </b>
  This is the fallacy
of assuming that A caused B simply because A happened prior to B. A favorite
example: "Most rapists read pornography when they were teenagers; obviously,
pornography causes violence toward women." The conclusion is invalid, because
there can be a correlation between two phenomena without one causing the
other. Often, this is because both phenomena may be linked to the same
cause. In the example given, it is possible that some psychological factor
-- say, a frustrated sex drive -- might cause both a tendency toward sexual
violence and a desire for pornographic material, in which case the pornography
would not be the true cause of the violence.
 </p>
 <p>
  <i>
   Post hoc ergo propter hoc

  </i>
  , which you should see for further details.
 </p>
 <p>
  <a name="Red herring">
  </a>
  <b>
   Red herring.
  </b>
  This means exactly what
you think it means: introducing irrelevant facts or arguments to distract
from the question at hand. For example, "The opposition claims that welfare
dependency leads to higher crime rates -- but how are poor people supposed
to keep a roof over their heads without our help?" It is perfectly valid
to ask this question as part of the broader debate, but to pose it as a
response to the argument about welfare leading to crime is fallacious.
(There is also an element of
  <i>
   <a href="http://www.csun.edu/%7Edgw61315/fallacies.html#Argumentum%20ad%20misericordiam">
    ad
misericordiam
   </a>
  </i>
  in this example.)
 </p>
 <p>
  It is not fallacious, however, to argue that benefits of one kind may
justify incurring costs of another kind. In the example given, concern
about providing shelter for the poor would not refute concerns about crime,
but one could plausibly argue that a somewhat higher level of crime is
a justifiable price given the need to alleviate poverty. This is a debatable
point of view, but it is no longer a fallacious one.
 </p>
 <p>
  The term red herring is sometimes used loosely to refer to any kind
of diversionary tactic, such as presenting relatively unimportant arguments
that will use up the other debaters' speaking time and distract them from
more important issues. This kind of a red herring is a wonderful strategic
maneuver with which every debater should be familiar.
 </p>
 <p>
  <a name="Slippery slope">
  </a>
  <b>
   Slippery slope.
  </b>
  A slippery slope
argument is not always a fallacy.  A slippery slope fallacy is an
argument that says adopting one policy or taking one action will lead to
a series of other policies or actions also being taken,
  <i>
   without showing
a causal connection between the advocated policy and the consequent policies
  </i>
  .
A popular example of the slippery slope fallacy is, "If we legalize marijuana,
the next thing you know we'll legalize heroin, LSD, and crack cocaine."
This slippery slope is a form of
  <i>
   <a href="#Non%20sequitur">
    non sequitur
   </a>
  </i>
  ,
because no reason has been provided for why legalization of one thing leads
to legalization of another. Tobacco and alcohol are currently legal, and
yet other drugs have somehow remained illegal.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are a variety of ways to turn a slippery slope fallacy into a
valid (or at least plausible) argument. All you need to do is provide some
  <i>
   reason
  </i>
  why the adoption of one policy will lead to the adoption
of another. For example, you could argue that legalizing marijuana would
cause more people to consider the use of mind-altering drugs acceptable,
and those people will support more permissive drug policies across the
board. An alternative to the slippery slope argument is simply to point
out that the principles espoused by your opposition imply the acceptability
of certain other policies, so if we don't like those other policies, we
should question whether we really buy those principles. For instance, if
the proposing team argued for legalizing marijuana by saying, "individuals
should be able to do whatever they want with their own bodies," the opposition
could point out that that principle would also justify legalizing a variety
of other drugs -- so if we don't support legalizing other drugs, then maybe
we don't really believe in that principle.
 </p>
 <p>
  <a name="Straw man">
  </a>
  <b>
   Straw man.
  </b>
  This is the fallacy of refuting
a caricatured or extreme version of somebody's argument, rather than the
actual argument they've made. Often this fallacy involves putting words
into somebody's mouth by saying they've made arguments they haven't actually
made, in which case the straw man argument is a veiled version of
  <i>
   <a href="http://www.csun.edu/%7Edgw61315/fallacies.html#Argumentum%20ad%20logicam">
    argumentum
ad logicam
   </a>
  </i>
  . One example of a straw man argument would be to say,
"Mr. Jones thinks that capitalism is good because everybody earns whatever
wealth they have, but this is clearly false because many people just inherit
their fortunes," when in fact Mr. Jones had not made the "earnings" argument
and had instead argued, say, that capitalism gives most people an incentive
to work and save. The fact that some arguments made for a policy are wrong
does not imply that the policy itself is wrong.
 </p>
 <p>
  In debate, strategic use of a straw man can be very effective. A carefully
constructed straw man can sometimes entice an unsuspecting opponent into
defending a silly argument that he would not have tried to defend otherwise.
But this strategy only works if the straw man is not
  <i>
   too
  </i>
  different
from the arguments your opponent has actually made, because a really outrageous
straw man will be recognized as just that. The best straw man is not, in
fact, a fallacy at all, but simply a logical extension or amplification
of an argument your opponent has made.
 </p>
 <p>
  <a name="Tu quoque">
  </a>
  <b>
   <i>
    Tu quoque

  </b>
  This is
the fallacy of defending an error in one's reasoning by pointing out that
one's opponent has made the same error. An error is still an error, regardless
of how many people make it. For example, "They accuse us of making unjustified
assertions. But they asserted a lot of things, too!"
 </p>
 <p>
  Although clearly fallacious,
  <i>
   tu quoque
  </i>
  arguments play an important
role in debate because they may help establish who has done a better job
of debating (setting aside the issue of whether the proposition is true
or not). If both teams have engaged in
  <i>
   <a href="http://www.csun.edu/%7Edgw61315/fallacies.html#Argumentum%20ad%20hominem">
    ad
hominem
   </a>

  attacks, or both teams have made a few
  <a href="http://www.csun.edu/%7Edgw61315/fallacies.html#Argumentum%20ad%20misericordiam">
   appeals
to pity
  </a>
  , then it would hardly be fair to penalize one team for it but
not the other. In addition, it is not fallacious at all to point out that
certain advantages or disadvantages may apply equally to both positions
presented in a debate, and therefore they cannot provide a reason for favoring
one position over the other (such disadvantages are referred to as "non-unique").
In general, using
  <i>
   tu quoque
  </i>
  statements is a good way to assure that
judges make decisions based only on factors that distinguish between the
two sides.
