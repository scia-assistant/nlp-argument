        The need to believe in phony wonders sometimes

        The true-believer syndrome merits
      study by science. What is it that compels a person, past all reason, to believe the
      unbelievable. How can an otherwise sane individual become so enamored of a fantasy, an
      imposture, that even after it's exposed in the bright light of day he still clings to
      it--indeed, clings to it all the harder?

        <em>
         True-believer syndrome
        </em>
        is an expression coined by M. Lamar Keene to describe
    an
        <i>
         apparent
        </i>
        cognitive disorder characterized by believing in the reality of paranormal or
    supernatural events
        <i>
         after one has been presented overwhelming evidence that the event was
    fraudulently staged
        </i>
        . Keene is a reformed phony psychic who exposed religious
    racketeeringâto little effect, apparently. Phony faith healers, psychics, channelers,
    televangelist miracle workers, etc., are as abundant as ever.

        Keene believes that "the true-believer syndrome is the greatest thing phony
    mediums have going for them" because "no amount of logic can shatter a faith
    consciously based on a lie." That those suffering from true-believer syndrome are
    consciously lying to themselves hardly seems likely, however. Perhaps from the viewpoint
    of a fraud and hoaxer, the mark who is told the truth but who continues to have faith in
    you must seem to believe what he knows is a lie. Yet, this type of
        <a href="selfdeception.html">
         self-deception
        </a>
        need not involve
        <em>
         lying
        </em>
        to oneself.
    To lie to oneself would require admission that one believes what one knows is false. This
    does not seem logically possible. One can't believe or disbelieve what one
        <em>
         knows.
        </em>
        (
        <em>
         Belief
        </em>
        is distinct from
        <em>
         belief in
        </em>
        , which is a matter of
        <em>
         trust
        </em>
        rather than belief.)
        <em>
         Belief
        </em>
        and
        <em>
         disbelief
        </em>
        entail the possibility of
    error;
        <em>
         knowledge
        </em>
        implies that error is beyond reasonable probability. I may have
    overwhelming evidence that a "psychic" is a phony, yet still believe that
    paranormal events occur. I may be
        <em>
         deceiving
        </em>
        myself in such a case, but I don't
    think it is correct to say I am
        <em>
         lying
        </em>
        to myself.

       <font face="Arial" size="3">
        It is possible that those suffering from true-believer 
    syndrome simply do not believe that the weight of the evidence before them 
    revealing fraud is sufficient to overpower the weight of all those many 
    cases of supportive evidence from the past. The fact that the supportive 
    evidence was largely supplied by the same person exposed as a fraud is 
    suppressed. There is always the hope that no matter how many frauds are 
    exposed, at least one of the experiences might have been genuine. No one can 
    prove that all psychic "miracles" have been frauds; therefore, the true 
    believer may well reason that he or she is justified in keeping hope alive. 
    Such thinking is not completely illogical, though it may
        <i>
         seem
        </i>
        pathological to the one admitting the fraud.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: left">
       <font face="Arial" size="3">
        It does not seem as easy to explain why the true believer continues to
        <em>
         believe in
        </em>
        ,
    that is,
        <em>
         trust
        </em>
        the psychic once he has admitted his deception. Trusting someone
    who reveals he is a liar and a fraud seems irrational, and such a person must appear 
    so to
    the hoaxer. Some true believers may well be mad, but some may be deceiving themselves by assuming
    that it is possible that a person can have psychic powers without knowing it. 
    One
    could disbelieve in one's psychic ability, yet still actually possess paranormal powers.
    Just as there are people who
        <em>
         think
        </em>
        they have psychic powers but don't really have
    any such powers, there may be people who have psychic powers but think they don't.

        A study done by psychologists Barry Singer and Victor Benassi at California State
    University at Long Beach illustrates the will to believe in psychic powers in the face of
    contrary evidence. They brought in a performing magician, Craig Reynolds, to do some
    tricks for four introductory psychology classes. Two of the classes were not told that he
    was a magician who would perform some amateur magic tricks. They were told that he was a
    graduate student who claimed to have psychic powers. In those classes, the psychology
    instructor explicitly stated that he didn't believe that the graduate student or anyone
    else has psychic abilities. In the other two classes the students were told that the
    magician was a magician. Singer and Benassi reported that about two-thirds of the students
    in both groups believed Craig was psychic. The researchers were surprised to find no
    significant difference between the "magic" and "psychic" classes. They
    then made the same presentation to two more classes who were explicitly told that Craig
    had no psychic abilities and that he was going to do some tricks for them whereby he
    pretends to read minds and demonstrate psychic powers. Nevertheless, more than half the
    students believed Craig was psychic after seeing his act.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: left">
       <font face="Arial" size="3">
        Singer and Benassi then asked the students whether they thought magicians could do
    exactly what Craig did. Most of the students agreed that magicians could. Then they asked
    the students if they would like to change their estimate of Craig's psychic abilities in
    light of the negative data they themselves had provided. A few did, reducing the
    percentage of students believing in Craig's psychic powers to 55 percent. Then the
    students were asked to estimate how many so-called psychics were really fakes using
    magician's tricks. The consensus was that most "psychics" are frauds. The
    students were again asked if they wished to change their estimate of Craig's psychic
    powers. Again, a few did, but the percentage believing in Craig's psychic powers was still
    a hefty 52 percent. [Benassi and Singer; Hofstadter]

        For many people, the will to believe at times overrides the ability to think critically
    about the evidence for and against a belief. The concept of the 
    true-believer syndrome, however, does not help us understand
        <i>
         why
        </i>
        people believe in the psychic or
    supernatural abilities of admitted frauds. Since by definition
    those suffering from true-believer syndrome are irrationally committed to their beliefs,
    there is no point in arguing with them. Evidence and logical argument mean nothing to
    them. Such people are incapable of being persuaded by evidence and argument that
    their notions are in error.

        In any case, there are at least three types of true believers, though they are clearly related.
    One is the kind Keene was referring to, namely, the type of person who believes in
    paranormal or supernatural things contrary to the evidence. Their faith is unshakable
    even in the face of overwhelming evidence against them, e.g., those who refused to
    disbelieve in "

    avail. As they tried to will away the "bad energy" that they believed was 
    causing Debra's illness, Lynch, an M.D. who should know a diabetic when she 
    lives with one,  spoon-fed her partner orange juice. Debra Harrison had 
    co-invented Consegrity with Lynch and did not seek medical attention, even 
    though at the time of her death she showed all the signs of diabetes.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <font size="3">
         As a Medical School graduate ... Mary [Lynch] should have been able to 
    recognize that things were seriously wrong with my mother's health condition 
    during her final days. My mother was very hungry all of the time and ate 
    several large meals per day, but did not gain weight. Dozens of friends and 
    family stated that she was becoming fatigued and experienced exhaustion very 
    quickly. She had dropped weight from a healthy 150 lbs at 5'4" to a mere 95 
    lbs. She was weak and began to look aged as her muscle mass dropped. All of 
    these are the symptoms of a Type 2 diabetic.
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font size="3">
         The disease was onset and quickly depleted her fat reserves as her body 
    could no longer absorb nutrients from the food she ate. Thus, the 
    unexplained weight loss. As her body ran out of energy sources to burn she 
    began to lose muscle mass and became weak. Because her body was no longer 
    producing insulin, her blood sugar levels were at a dangerous vulnerability 
    as the sugars could no longer be used as energy. For a diabetic of this 
    type, without an insulin shot to utilize it, sugar becomes a deadly poison. 
    Normal blood sugar levels are below 110mg/dl. My mother's blood sugar levels 
    at the time of autopsy were recorded at 945 mg/dl
         <font face="Arial">
          â
         </font>
         600 
    mg/dl over the fatal limit.
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font size="3">
         How did this happen? Upon entering my mother's empty bedroom 24 hours 
    after her death, my siblings and I noticed 8 empty gallon-sized orange juice 
    containers sitting on the dresser....Upon relating the final moments of my 
    mother's life to my siblings and I, she stated that she had been spoon 
    feeding orange juice to my mother on her death bed. (David Harrison, 
    personal correspondence).

        Despite the fact that diabetes is treatable and that a medical doctor 
    should recognize obvious signs of the disease, Mary Lynch and Emily Harrison 
    maintain that it was the "negative energy" of family members that killed 
    Debra. What Lynch and Emily Harrison saw as negative energy, the family 
    members who were trying to get Debra to go to a hospital for treatment saw 
    as loving concern. Most rational people would see things the way the family 
    members did. Nevertheless, Emily Harrison
        <a href="http://energymirrors.com/feedback.htm">
         followed

        Dr. Lynch when

        Lynch's irrational beliefs are undoubtedly tied to her personal 
    investment in energy healing, but Emily Harrison's decision to reject her 
    relatives and move on with Dr. Lynch is typical of

        <font face="Arial">
         With this kind of irrational thinking, it is pointless to produce evidence 
    to try to persuade people of the error of their ways. Their belief is not 
    based on evidence, but on devotion to a person. That devotion can be so 
    great that even the most despicable behavior by one's guru can be 
    rationalized.

        One other type of true believer is described by Eric Hoffer in
    his book
        <em>
         The True Believer
        </em>
        . This type of person is irrationally committed to a
    cause like
        <a href="http://skepdic.com/refuge/bunk27.html">
         terrorist 
    attacks on civilians
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="http://www.now.org/nnt/winter-99/aborvio.html">
         murdering doctors who
    perform abortions
        </a>
        , or following a guru like
        <a href="http://religioustolerance.org/dc_jones.htm">
         Jim Jones
        </a>
        even to the point of murder or suicide.
       </font>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: left">
       <font face="Arial" size="3">
        One possible explanation for true-believer syndrome is 
    that the belief satisfies an emotional need that is stronger than any other 
    emotional need. Why some people have such a strong emotional need to believe 
    in something that rational people recognize as false is perhaps 
    unanswerable, but it is clear that the kind of beliefs we are discussing 
    here are based on emotions and feelings, not reason and evidence.
       </font>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: left">
       <font face="Arial" size="3">
        Why some people are willing to kill or be killed for 
    beliefs that wouldn't pass muster with most rational folks is even more 
    puzzling. It may have to
    do with insecurity. Eric Hoffer seemed to think so. He wrote:
       </font>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <font face="Arial" size="3">
         <strong style="font-weight: 400">
          The less justified a man is in claiming excellence for his own self, the more
      ready he is to claim all excellence for his nation, his religion, his race or his holy
      cause....
          <br/>
          <br/>
          A man is likely to mind his own business when it is worth minding. When it is not, he
      takes his mind off his own meaningless affairs by minding other people's business....
         </strong>
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font face="Arial" size="3">
         <strong style="font-weight: 400">
          The fanatic is perpetually incomplete and insecure. He cannot generate
      self-assurance out of his individual resources -- out of his rejected self -- but finds it
      only by clinging passionately to whatever support he happens to embrace. This passionate
      attachment is the essence of his blind devotion and religiosity, and he sees in it the
      source of all virtue and strength.... He easily sees himself as the supporter and defender
      of the holy cause to which he clings. And he is ready to sacrifice his life.
         </strong>
        </font>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p style="text-align: left">
       <font face="Arial" size="3">
        Hoffer also seemed to think that true believers want to give up all personal responsibility for 
    their beliefs and actions. They want to be free of the burden of
    freedom.
