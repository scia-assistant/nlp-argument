          An auxilliary hypothesis that lacks independent support which is adopted to save a theory from refutation.  Such hypotheses are bad because any theory can be rescued from refutation in this way.  Auxilliary hypotheses should be justified by independent evidence.

            Before Kepler, astronomers believed that planets moved in circular orbits.  However, observations of planetary positions did not fit with this theory.  The theory was saved from refutation by adopting the
            <em>
             ad hoc
            </em>
            hypothesis of epicycles.  Of course, the theory should have been rejected because planets do not move in circular orbits.

The suffix is used in many medical terms for surgical operations, for instance, "appendectomy", which means the surgical removal of the appendix.  So, a "contextomy" is the removal of a quote from its context.  This word appears to have been coined by Milton Mayer

For instance, the relation of being shorter than is the inverse of the relation of being taller than; if Jack is taller than Jill, then Jill is shorter than Jack.  In other words, the relationship of height between Jack and Jill is the same, but in the first case Jack bears the relation to Jill, whereas in the second Jill bears it to Jack.
