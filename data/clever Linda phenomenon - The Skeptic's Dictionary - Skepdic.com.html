      <h1>
       clever Linda phenomenon
      </h1>
      <p style="text-align: left">
       <font face="Arial" size="3">
        A form of involuntary and unconscious cuing. The 
                term refers to a speech therapist (Linda Wouters) who responded 
                to questions asked of Belgian Rom Houben by guiding Houben's 
                finger to letters on a special touch-screen keyboard. At the 
                time of the first public announcement of the clever Linda 
                phenomenon in November 2009, Houben was 46-years-old and had 
                been paralyzed for 23 years
        <img border="0" height="151" src="graphics/cleverlinda.jpg" width="181"/>
        due 
                to a brain injury suffered in a car crash. Houben had been 
                diagnosed as being in a persistent vegetative state (PVT) until 
                three years earlier, when Dr. Stephen Laureys, a Belgian 
                neurologist, declared that new tests showed Houben was conscious 
                and had
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locked-in_syndrome">
         locked-in syndrome.
        </a>
        Usually, if a patient with locked-in 
                syndrome can communicate, it is by blinking an eye (or, in 
                Houben's case, moving a toe).  The new diagnosis was the 
    result of Rom's mother's belief that her son was conscious and her 
    persistence in taking him to several clinics over the years for new testing.

      <p style="text-align: left">
       <font face="Arial" size="3">
        Both Dr. 
                Laureys and Linda maintain that she is responding to subtle 
                pressure from Houben's fingers and that she "feels him objecting 
                when she moves his hand toward an incorrect letter."
        <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/832/story/2344474.html">
         *
        </a>
        Video reports show, however, that Linda looks at the keyboard 
                while Rom's eyes are closed, responds very quickly to questions, 
                and moves from letter to letter at a speedy pace. Even a very 
                clever person who had memorized the location of each letter on 
                the board would have a hard time finding any given letter with 
                his eyes closed since there would be no point of reference. 
                Linda is engaging in a practice known as
        <a href="http://skepdic.com/facilcom.html">
         facilitated 
                communication
        </a>
        , which has been shown to be a cruel hoax. It 
                should be emphasized that while facilitated communication has 
                been shown to be without scientific merit, practitioners like 
                Linda respond to unconscious cues and should not be accused of 
                conscious fraud without compelling evidence.

        Dr. 
                Stephen Novella commented after watching
                
                a video of Linda and Rom:
       </font>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p style="text-align: left">
        <font size="3">
         We see Linda Wouters, 
                Houbenâs âfacilitatorâ, looking intently at the screen and 
                typing away, while Houben looks away with his eyes closed. No 
                one can one-finger type without looking at the screen. Wouters 
                claims to read the subtle cues from Houbenâs intent â this 
                despite the fact that clinical exams revealed his hand was 
                completely paralyzed. The video also does not show what Wouters 
                claims â following subtle muscle cues is very difficult, and 
                would require (if at all possible) a gentle touch and some time 
                to zero in on the intent, most likely with some overshooting . 
                Again, what we see in the video is a woman typing very fast and 
                precisely using Houbenâs paralyzed hand.

        Dr. Laureys could have 
                eliminated the charge of clever Linda phenomenon by doing a more 
                rigorous test, one that eliminates the possibility of ideomotor 
                action guiding her hand or providing her cues from subtle 
                movements she unconsciously detects in others present.

                done a different test and at least made some effort to verify 
                that Houben is sending subtle physical signals to Linda. One 
                might think that blindfolding Linda would do the trick, but 
                blindfolds don't always prevent one from seeing, especially if 
                one looks down the sides of

        one's nose, which is what Linda would be doing. (He sits in a 
                wheelchair while she stands behind and to his right.) Still, if 
                a good method were used to prevent Linda from seeing while Rom 
                guided her hand to letters on the keyboard, that would be a 
                convincing test. Another test would be to put a divider 
                between Rom and Linda, show pictures on each side of the 
                divider, and ask Rom what he sees. If the clever Linda 
                phenomenon is at work, the only time Rom would give a correct 
                answer would be when both he and Linda were shown the same 
                object. If Rom gives a correct answer every time, then Linda is 
                really communicating his thoughts, not her own.

        Another test was 
                suggested to me by Conway Redding: put earphones on Houben and 
                Wouters and ask them questions. If the only time Houben answers 
                correctly is when both are asked the same question, then the 
                clever Linda phenomenon would be supported. If Linda answers the 
                question put to Houben rather than to her, then the clever Linda 
                phenomenon would be falsified.

        Most journalists and 
                many physicians are 
                not familiar with clever Linda phenomenon, the ideomotor effect, 
                or facilitated communication. For example, the Belgian RTBF 
                network showed Linda responding to a question asked of Rom: 
                "Powerlessness. Utter powerlessness. At first I was angry, then 
                I learned to live with it." A reporter for the

        </a>
        wrote that "he" said these things, not 
                Linda. The reporter, Raf Casert even described Rom as "punching 
                the message into the screen during an interview." No mention was 
                made of Linda. A

        Again, the 
                journalists take it for granted that Houben, not Linda is doing 
                the communicating. While there is no reason to doubt that Dr. 
                Laureys is correct that a PET scan shows Rom's brain is 
                functioning and he is not in a vegetative state, there is every 
                reason to believe that the clever Linda phenomenon is at work in 
                his alleged communication, as this video from CBS clearly shows. 
                Rom appears to be sleeping while Linda types away at the special 
                keyboard.

        I am called Rom. I am not dead. The nurses came, they

                  "no hope." I meditated, I dreamed my life away--it was all I 
                  could do. I don't want to blame anyone--it wouldn't do any 
                  good. But I owe my life to my family. Everyone else gave up.

        I studied what happened around me as if it were a tiny 
                  piece of world drama, the bizarre peculiarities of the other 
                  patients in the common room, the entry of the doctors into my 
                  room, the gossip of the nurses who were not embarrassed to 
                  speak about their boyfriends in front of "the extinct one." 
                  That made me an expert on relationships.

                as "Facilitated Communication" [FC] represents anything other 
                than a fantasy that was begun back in 1977, when an Australian 
                woman named Rosemary Crossley came up with the idea that 
                autistic persons could express their thoughts via a keyboard 
                when their hand was "supported" by what she called a 
                "facilitator."

         Story Of Book-Writing Coma Patient Debunked

       <font size="3">
        Several months ago, a 
                man in Belgium named Rom Houben was said to be writing a book 
                more than 20 years after doctors concluded that a car crash had 
                left him in a vegetative state.

      <p style="text-align: left">
       <font size="3">
        Houben had gained 
                international fame for supposedly revealing his innermost 
                thoughts through a technique called
        <a href="facilcom.html">
         facilitated communication
        </a>
        .
       </font>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: left">
       <font size="3">
        Now, it looks like 
                those initial reports were wrong.
       </font>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: left">
       <font size="3">
        Houben's neurologist, 
                Dr. Steven Laureys, says a scientific test has shown that his 
                patient cannot answer even simple questions....In the test, the 
                man who was supposed to be writing a novel failed to identify an 
                apple through facilitated communication.
