     Etymology:
    </h3>
    <p>
     The name "bandwagon fallacy" comes from the phrase "jump on the bandwagon" or "climb on the bandwagon", a bandwagon being a wagon big enough to hold a band of musicians.  In past political campaigns, candidates would ride a bandwagon through town, and people would show support for the candidate by climbing aboard the wagon.  The phrase has come to refer to joining a cause because of its popularity.

           <strong>
            Q:
           </strong>
           I have recently been thinking about the possibility of the system of democracy being based on the Appeal to Popularity fallacy:
           <table>
            <tr>
             <th>
              Form
             </th>
             <th>
              Instance
             </th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
             <td>
              Idea X is popular.
              <br/>
              Therefore, X is correct.
             </td>
             <td>
              Idea of a specific politician being president is popular.
              <br/>
              Therefore, the specific politician is the more competent leader.
             </td>
            </tr>
           </table>
           <p>
            However, I am unable to verify that this is the case.  It also conflicts with the possibility that the election of a leader based on his/her popularity is not to determine whether the selection is right or wrong, but rather to fulfill the desires of the people.  I hope to hear your opinion on this issue.â€•M.F.
            <p>
             <strong>
              A:
             </strong>
             Your latter suggestion is on the right track.  Keep in mind that a logical fallacy is a type of argument, that is, a set of
             <a href="glossary.html#Proposition">
              proposition
             </a>
             s consisting of
             <a href="glossary.html#Premiss">
              premiss
             </a>
             es and a
             <a href="glossary.html#Conclusion">
              conclusion
             </a>
             .  An election is not an argument with the conclusion that, say, a certain candidate will make the best president; rather, an election is a way of selecting a candidate for a position.  Since an election isn't an argument,
             <a href="glossary.html#Afortiori">
              a fortiori
             </a>
             , it isn't a
             <a href="glossary.html#Fallacious">
              fallacious
             </a>
             argument.  So, to criticize democracy as a bandwagon appeal would be to commit a
             <a href="glossary.html#CategoryMistake">
              category mistake
             </a>
             , because a political system is not the sort of thing to be fallacious.
             <p>
              A genuine instance of the bandwagon fallacy is the argument that you should vote for a certain candidate because the majority of people support that candidate, or the candidate is popular.  This is the origin of the phrase "to jump on the bandwagon".
              <p>
               Of course, none of this is to say whether democracy is the best, or even a good, way of choosing candidates for office.  However, it
               <em>
                is
               </em>
               to say that evaluating democracy is not a purely logical question, but an ethical, philosophical, and even empirical question.
