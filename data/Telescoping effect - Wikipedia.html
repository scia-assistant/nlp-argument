    The approximate time frame in which events switch from being displaced backward in time to forward in time is three years, with events occurring three years in the past being equally likely to be reported with forward telescoping bias as with backward telescoping bias.

    Although telescoping occurs in both the forward and backward directions, in general the effect is to increase the number of events reported too recently.

     The term telescoping comes from the idea that time seems to shrink toward the present in the way that the distance to objects seems to shrink when they are viewed through a telescope.

     Another way of interpreting this theory is that people estimate the dates of events based on the number of personal events that have occurred since the target event.

     Some psychologists have suggested that telescoping occurs because people are guessing the date of an event. According to this theory, if a person is unsure of a date, they minimize their chance of erring by placing events toward the middle of the period.

     Rubin and Baddley created the boundary model to explain telescoping. When people date events, they often get information from a bounded period, such as a year or a vacation.

     This model assumes events are not assigned outside of the boundaries of this period, so dating errors can only move toward the middle of a boundary and that since recent events are dated more accurately, forward telescoping has a stronger effect.

     Kemp argued that people use an association strategy that links target events to other events for which dating information is available.

     This approach assumes that the date of an event is determined by using memories from other similar events, that ability to recall relevant information decreases overtime, and that the associated event is more likely to be more recent than the actual event because the ability to retrieve information decreases overtime.

     Other psychologists believe that the telescoping errors that have been reported in studies are not due to a phenomenon of memory, but demand characteristics. Responses to questions about the frequency of behavior can be biased because of demand characteristics. Respondents may provide too much information, rather than too little, because they are trying to provide as much useful information as possible, and therefore over-report the frequency of events. Some researchers perceive this over reporting as telescoping because people are including events beyond the given period, but the over reporting could be due to the demand characteristics of the study. Demand characteristics can explain the appearance of forward telescoping, but cannot explain backwards telescoping and can not explain the inaccurate recall of dates when respondents are not led to believe that a certain answer is desirable.

     Psychologists have studied the telescoping effect in children because a person's development can have a significant impact on his or her memory.  Telescoping occurs at all ages, but to different degrees. Older children have a greater tendency to telescope earlier memories and a weaker tendency to telescope recent memories than younger children. Children's telescoping errors occur for their earliest memories. This finding is significant because it probably occurs for adults as well, and therefore people's earliest memories are reported as more recent than they actually are. This finding indicates that the earliest memories reported in
     <a href="/wiki/Childhood_amnesia" title="Childhood amnesia">
      childhood amnesia

     The way a question is phrased is an important factor in minimizing the telescoping effect. If a question clearly defines the time period of interest, telescoping errors will be reduced.

     Neter and Waksberg also developed a procedure called bounded recall to help decrease the effect of telescoping. In preliminary interviews, participants are asked about events, and then, in later interviews, participants are reminded of these events and then asked about additional occurrences. One limitation of this process is that it requires information from preliminary interviews be correct.

     A person's temporal framework is also related to the amount of telescoping errors that they make.  As a person's temporal framework becomes more elaborate, they have more reference points from which to date events and commit fewer telescoping errors.

     The telescoping effect is pertinent for behaviors such as smoking and alcohol usage, especially when they are early onset behaviors.  Studies of the telescoping effect have examined the reported age of onset of

     </a>
     ,
     <a href="/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)" title="Alcohol (drug)">
      alcohol
     </a>
     , and drug use.  Forward telescoping has been found in reported age of initial use of cigarettes and in reported age of beginning daily smoking.

     Therefore, people may be misclassified as having late onset of drug use, when in reality, they had early onset.

     Forward telescoping of risky behaviors can be problematic in monitoring patients for issues associated with early onset drug use because if they are misclassified, they may not be correctly monitored.

     Marketing firms often use survey data to estimate when consumers will next buy a product. Telescoping errors may bias these estimates and cause faulty marketing campaigns. Respondents on marketing research surveys are often inaccurate when recalling the time period of their last purchase, and forward telescoping is common.

        ]
       </span>
      </a>
     </sup>
     Backward telescoping is also common and leads to respondents overstating their intention to buy a replacement product as they underestimate the likelihood of their product breaking down.
