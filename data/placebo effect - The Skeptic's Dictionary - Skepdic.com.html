        The placebo effect is the measurable, observable, or felt improvement in 
    health or behavior not attributable to a medication or invasive treatment that has been 
    administered.
       </font>
       The placebo effect is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       mind over matter; it is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       mind-body medicine. 'The placebo effect' has become a catchall term for a positive change in health
       <em>
        not attributable to medication or  treatment.
       </em>
       As is explained below, the change can be due to many things, such as regression to the mean, spontaneous improvement, reduction of stress, misdiagnosis in the first place, subject expectancy, classical conditioning, etc.

      <p style="text-align: left">

        A placebo (Latin for "I shall please") is a 
    pharmacologically inert substance (such as saline solution or a starch 
    tablet) that  seems to produce an effect similar to what would be expected of a 
    pharmacologically active substance (such as an antibiotic).

         The idea
        </a>
        of the placebo in modern 
      times originated with H. K. Beecher. He evaluated 15 clinical trials 
      concerned with different diseases and found that 35% of 1,082 patients 
      were satisfactorily relieved by a placebo alone ("The Powerful Placebo," 1955). Other studies
      have since calculated the placebo effect as being even greater than Beecher claimed. For
      example, studies have shown that placebos are effective in 50 or 60
      percent of subjects with certain conditions, e.g., "pain, depression,
      some heart ailments, gastric ulcers and other stomach complaints."

        And, as effective as the new psychotropic drugs seem to be in the
      treatment of various brain disorders,
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0471148482/roberttoddcarrolA/">
         some
      researchers maintain
        </a>
        that there is not adequate evidence from studies
      to prove that the new drugs are more effective than placebos.

        Beecher started a wave of studies 
      aimed at understanding how something (improvement in health) could be 
      produced by nothing (the inactive placebo). Unfortunately, many of the 
      studies have not been of particularly high quality and have assumed that any measured improvement was
        <em>
         caused by
        </em>
        the placebo. In fact,
        <a name="falseplacebo">
         it has been argued 
      by
        </a>
        Kienle and Kiene (
        <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=pubmed&amp;uid=9449934&amp;cmd=showdetailview&amp;indexed=google">
         1997
        </a>
        ) 
      that, contrary to what Beecher claimed, a reanalysis of his data found "no 
      evidence of any placebo effect in any of the studies cited by him." The 
      reported improvements in heath were real but were due to other things that 
      produced "false impressions of placebo effects." The reanalysis of 
      Beecher's data claims that the improvements were due to:
       </font>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p align="left">
        <font face="Arial" size="3">
         Spontaneous 
      improvement, fluctuation of symptoms,
         <a href="regressive.html">
          regression
         </a>
         to the 
      mean, additional treatment, conditional switching of placebo treatment, 
      scaling bias, irrelevant response variables, answers of politeness, 
      experimental subordination, conditioned answers, neurotic or psychotic 
      misjudgment, psychosomatic phenomena, misquotation, etc.
        </font>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="left">
       <font face="Arial" size="3">
        What the reanalysis shows is that 
      there are a number of factors that can affect many treatments and the 
      evaluation of those treatments, making it 
      very difficult to be sure just what it is about an intervention that 
      produces improvement or perceived improvement. We must also consider "artifacts such as the 
      natural history of a disease (that is, the tendency for people to get 
      better or worse during the course of an illness irrespective of any 
      treatment at all), the fact that people behave differently when they are 
      participating in an experiment than when they are not, a desire to please 
      the experimental staff by providing socially desirable answers..." (Bausell 
      2007: 27), and a host of other factors unrelated to the pill we are 
      administering and independently of any mechanism that we believe is 
      producing any observed effects.

         meta-analysis

        of 114 studies found that
      "compared with no treatment, placebo had no significant effect on
      binary outcomes, regardless of whether these outcomes were subjective or
      objective. For the trials with continuous outcomes, placebo had a
      beneficial effect, but the effect decreased with increasing sample size,
      indicating a possible bias related to the effects of small trials." (Most of the studies evaluated by  HrÃ³bjartsson and
      GÃ¶tzsche were small: for 82 of the studies the median size was 27 and for
      the other 32 studies the median was 51.)

        "The high levels of placebo effect which have been
      repeatedly reported in many articles, in our mind are the result of flawed
      research methodology," said Dr.  HrÃ³bjartsson, professor of medical
      philosophy and research methodology at the University of Copenhagen.
        <font face="Arial" size="3">
         Typical of the kind of flawed research methodology
      
      HrÃ³bjartsson is referring to would be that of surgeon J. Bruce Moseley who

      knee surgery on eight of ten patients.

         (Fake surgery involves making 
      an incision on the knee and stitching it up.) Six months after the surgery
      all the patients were satisfied customers. Rather than conclude that the
      patients didn't need surgery or that the surgery was useless because in
      time the patients would have healed on their own, he and others concluded
      that the healing of the eight who did not have surgery was due to the
      placebo effect, while the two who had real surgery were better because of
      having had the operation. Irving
      Kirsch and Guy Sapirstein have been accused of making the same kind of methodological error
      in their controversial meta-analysis that found that anti-depressants work
      by the placebo effect, rather than that anti-depressants are unnecessary
      and useless.

         Forty years ago, a young Seattle cardiologist
    named Leonard Cobb conducted a unique trial of a procedure then commonly
    used for angina, in which doctors made small incisions in the chest and tied
    knots in two arteries to try to increase blood flow to the heart. It was a
    popular techniqueâ90 percent of patients reported that it helpedâbut
    when Cobb compared it with placebo surgery in which he made incisions but
    did not tie off the arteries, the sham operations proved just as successful.
    The procedure, known as internal mammary ligation, was soon abandoned

        To rule out the natural history of a 
      disease or regression to the mean, many researchers have used
      a third control groupâthose who receive no treatment at all. If the placebo group shows better results than the group getting
      nothing, then surely the placebo is effective.  HrÃ³bjartsson and
      GÃ¶tzsche think most of these studies, too, are flawed, mainly due to
      having samples that are too small or due to patients who make reports

        After the publication of the  HrÃ³bjartsson and

      John C. Bailar III said in an editorial that accompanied the study: 
      "The shoe is on the other foot now. The people who claim there are placebo 
      effects are going to have to show it." The need, he said, is for large, rigorously designed
      studies that clearly define and measure effects of drugs and therapies
      versus placebos versus no intervention at all. These studies will have to
      clearly distinguish objective measurements (such as blood pressure,
      cholesterol levels, etc.) and subjective measurements (such as reports of
      pain or evaluative sensory observations by researchers, e.g., "I can
      see your tumor is smaller" or "I can see you are not as

         [a powerful pain reliever] on request for 3 consecutive days, together 
      with a basal intravenous infusion of saline solution. However, the 
      symbolic meaning of this basal infusion was changed in three different 
      groups of patients. The first group was told nothing about any analgesic 
      effect (natural history). The second group was told that the basal 
      infusion was either a powerful painkiller or a placebo (classic 
      double-blind administration). The third group was told that the basal 
      infusion was a potent painkiller (deceptive administration). Therefore, 
      whereas the analgesic treatment was exactly the same in the three groups, 
      the verbal instructions about the basal infusion differed. The placebo 
      effect of the saline basal infusion was measured by recording the doses of 
      buprenorphine requested over the three-days treatment. We found that the 
      double-blind group showed a reduction of buprenorphine requests compared 
      to the natural history group. However, this reduction was even larger in 
      the deceptive administration group. Overall, after 3 days of placebo 
      infusion, the first group received 11.55 mg of buprenorphine, the second 
      group 9.15 mg, and the third group 7.65 mg. Despite these dose 
      differences, analgesia was the same in the three groups. These results 
      indicate that different verbal instructions about certain and uncertain 
      expectations of analgesia produce different placebo analgesic effects, 
      which in turn trigger a dramatic change of behaviour leading to a 
      significant reduction of opioid intake.

      were told the IV could be either a powerful pain killer or a placebo. Each 
      group got exactly the same amount of pain killer but their requests for 
      the analgesic differed dramatically. The only significant difference among 
      the three groups was the set of verbal instructions about the basal 
      infusion. The study was too short for the differences to be explained by 
      the natural history of recovery, regression, or any of the other

        Several things are worth noting about 
      this experiment. The setting involves treatment being provided by medical 
      personnel in a medical facility. This kind of setting usually involves a 
      strong desire for recovery or relief on the part of the patient, as well 
      as a belief that the treatment will be effective. The different verbal 
      instructions about the basal IV would lead to different expectations.

        . Irving Kirsch, a psychologist at the University of Connecticut,
      believes that the effectiveness of Prozac and similar drugs may be
      attributed almost entirely to the placebo effect. He and Guy Sapirstein
      analyzed
        19 clinical trials of antidepressants and concluded that the expectation
        of improvement, not adjustments in brain chemistry, accounted for 75
        percent of the drugs' effectiveness (Kirsch
      1998).  "The critical factor," says Kirsch, "is our
      beliefs about what's going to happen to us. You don't have to rely on
      drugs to see profound transformation." In an earlier study, Sapirstein
      analyzed 39 studies, done between 1974 and 1995, of depressed patients
      treated with drugs, psychotherapy, or a combination of both. He found that
      50 percent of the drug effect is due to the placebo response.

        A person's
    beliefs and hopes about a treatment, combined with their suggestibility, may
      have a significant biochemical effect, however. Sensory experience and thoughts can
      affect neurochemistry. The body's neurochemical system affects and is affected by other biochemical
    systems, including the hormonal and immune systems. Thus, it is consistent
      with current knowledge that a person's hopeful attitude and beliefs may be
      very
      important to their physical well-being
    and recovery from injury or illness.

        The psychological explanation seems to be the one most commonly
      believed. Perhaps this is why many people are dismayed when they are told
      that the effective drug they are taking is a placebo. This makes them
      think that their problem is "all in their mind" and that there
      is really nothing wrong with them. Yet, there are too many studies that
      have found objective improvements in health after being given placebos to support the
      notion that the placebo effect is entirely psychological.

        So, what is the explanatory mechanism for the placebo
        effect? Some
        think it is the
        <i>
         process
        </i>
        of administering it. It is thought that the
        touching, the caring, the attention, and other interpersonal communication
        that is part of the controlled study process (or the therapeutic setting),
        along with the hopefulness and encouragement provided by the
        experimenter/healer, affect the mood, expectations, and beliefs of the subject, which in turn
        triggers physical changes such as release of endorphins, catecholamines, 
        cortisol, or adrenaline. The process
        reduces stress by providing hope or reducing uncertainty about what
        treatment to take or what the outcome will be. The reduction in stress
        prevents or slows down further harmful physical changes from occurring. 
        The healing situation provokes a conditioned response. The patient's 
        been healed before by the doctor (or thinks she's been healed before by 
        the doctor) and expects to be healed again.

        Because the

      susceptibility to placebo effects. Andrew Leuchter et al. postulated that

      which are under strong genetic control. Their findings "support the

      related to degree of placebo responsiveness in major depressive disorder."

        The power of the placebo effect has led to an ethical
      dilemma. One should not deceive other people, but one should relieve the
      pain and suffering of one's patients. Should one use deception to benefit
      one's patients? Is it unethical for a doctor to knowingly prescribe a
      placebo without informing the patient? If informing the patient reduces
      the effectiveness of the placebo, is some sort of deception warranted in
      order to benefit the patient? Some doctors think it is justified to use a
      placebo in those types of cases where a strong placebo effect has been
      shown and where distress is an aggravating factor.

        Others think it is always wrong to deceive the patient and that informed 
      consent requires that the patient be told that a treatment is a placebo 
      treatment. Others, especially
        <a href="compmed.html">
         complementary and 
      alternative medicine
        </a>
        (CAM) practitioners, don't even want to know 
      whether a treatment is a placebo or not. Their attitude is that as long as 
      the treatment is effective, who cares if it a placebo?

       <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2012/01/17/does-thinking-make-it-so/">
        This attitude is changing, however, and it is now common to find defenders of CAM admit that CAM is placebo medicine and go on to claim that that's why CAM is
        <em>

      Clearly, they can't cure cancer or repair a punctured lung, and they might
      not even prolong life by giving hope and relieving distress as is
      sometimes thought. But administering placebo therapies does involve interacting
      with the patient in a caring, attentive way, and this can provide some
      measure of comfort. However, to those who say "what difference
    does it make
        <i>
         why
        </i>
        something works, as long as it seems to work" I reply that it is likely that
    there is something that works even better and might even be cheaper. Worse, 
      some people might seek out an alternative healer for a serious disorder that 
      isn't affected by the CAM treatment but could be relieved or cured by 
      scientific medicine. Furthermore,
    placebos may not always be beneficial or harmless. John Dodes notes:

         Patients can become dependent on nonscientific practitioners who employ placebo

      filling amalgam "toxicity," or that they're under the power of 
      qi or

        In other words, the placebo can be an open door to malfeasance.  
    R. Barker Bausell speculates that since
        <a href="compmed.html">
         complementary and alternative 
    medicine (CAM)

        practitioners' greatest asset is their nourishment of hope 
    (2007: 294), "such therapies may be engendering nothing more than the 
    expectation that they will reduce pain by elaborate explanations, promises, 
    and ceremonies" (p. 149). Packaging placebos is big business and is likely to get 
    even bigger. The only thing that could slow down CAM atavism would be the 
    sudden appearance of horrible side effects issuing from  treatments 
    like aura cleansings or homeopathic douches.

           Crislip doesn't beat around the bush. Fair enough. Since I've been maintaining that hypnotherapy is indistinguishable from a placebo and that the many satisfied customers of things like acupuncture and homeopathy can be explained by the placebo effect, I think I ought to respond.
          </p>
          <p>
           Crislip is a practicing infectious disease doctor in Portland, Oregon. He is author of theÂ
           <a href="http://www.quackcast.com/">
            Quackcast
           </a>
           Â podcast (a review of supplements, complementary and so-called alternative medicine), a blog, and a couple of other podcasts on medical issues.
          </p>
          <p>
           He begins his argument by dividing outcomes thatÂ
           <em>
            don't
           </em>
           Â occur into two types: objective and subjective. He explains this division by reference to the 2001 article by Asbjorn Hrobjartsson, M.D., and Peter C. GÃ¶tzsche, M.D.:Â
           <a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/344/21/1594">
            "Is the Placebo Powerless - An Analysis of Clinical Trials Comparing Placebo with No Treatment,"
           </a>
           Â which appeared in the
           <em>
            Â New England Journal of Medicine.Â
           </em>
           That study found no significant difference between placebo and no treatment groups, but it did find "possible small benefits in studies with continuous subjective outcomes and for the treatment of pain." The objective part of pain has to do with trauma to nerves and signals to the brain. The subjective part has to do with the feeling and appreciation of pain. In short, there is the bodily trauma and there is your feeling and perception of the trauma to your body. They are, obviously, quite distinct.
          </p>
          <p>
           Crislip's view is that "the placebo effect with pain is a mild example of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT); the pain stays the same, it is the emotional response that is altered." He doesn't fill in the argument here, but he seems to be implying that since we do not consider CBT a placebo and CBT works by altering emotional responses, other treatments that work by altering emotional responses are not placebos, either.
          </p>
          <p>
           Crislip then analyzes a 2006 BMJ article: "
           <a href="http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/abstract/bmj.38726.603310.55v1?ck=nck">
            Sham device v inert pill: randomised controlled trial of two placebo treatments
           </a>
           . The objective of the study was to determine whetherÂ
           <a href="http://skepdic.com/shamacupuncture.html">
            sham acupuncture
           </a>
           Â has a greater placebo effect than an inert pill in patients with persistent arm pain. The researchers found no difference in objective results but the sham acupuncture had greater subjective effects than the placebo pill. The researchers concluded: "Placebo effects seem to be malleable and depend on the behaviours embedded in medical rituals." Crislip concludes: "Ain't no such thing as a placebo effect, only a change in perception." However, in presenting his defense, Crislip provides evidence for an important element of placebo and
           <a href="http://skepdic.com/nocebo.html">
            nocebo
           </a>
           Â effects:Â
           <em>
            suggestion
           </em>
           . He writes:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            Two different placebos decreased pain, one placebo was better than the other. Why?
           </p>
           <p>
            The answer may be in another interesting result of the study: side effects. Patients were told in the informed consent what the side effects of the active therapies were, even though initially they all were getting placebo. And the informed consent worked to âcauseâ side effects: three of the placebo subjects dropped out from dry mouth and fatigue and 10% of the sham had increased pain after the needle was âremovedâ.
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           Crislip then goes on to unintentionally add support for another important element of placebo effects:Â
           <em>
            expectation
           </em>
           . There is good evidence, he notes, that expectation significantly affects how things taste to us. "People have the result they expect to have and the side effects they are told they will have." If I understand him, he seems to be saying that if there is only a subjective effect to a treatment, then there is no placebo effect. If this is so, then his argument is a one of semantics. So, when he writes "In humans there is no ârealâ effect from placebo," he means there is no objective effect, only a subjective effect.
          </p>
          <p>
           He concludes his argument by noting that he couldn't find any evidence from scientific studies on a placebo effect in animals.
          </p>
          <p>
           To the argument that some relief from pain from placebo treatments comes from the release of endorphins, Crislip responds by noting that in his own case involving several surgeries, he only got relief from one surgery that didn't require him to take pain killers.
          </p>
          <p>
           I see two problems with his argument. The first I've already noted. He defines placebo effect in such a way as to exclude subjective effects from suggestion or expectation. Second, his selection of studies to review ignores those studies that have found an objective placebo effect. In my entry inÂ
           <em>
            The Skeptic's Dictionary
           </em>
           Â on the placebo effect, I note that after the publication of the study by Hrobjartsson and GÃ¶tzsche:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p align="left">
            Dr. John C. Bailar III saidÂ in an editorial that accompanied the study: "The shoe is on the other foot now. The people who claim there are placebo effects are going to have to show it." The need, he said, is for large, rigorously designed studies that clearly define and measure effects of drugs and therapies versus placebos versus no intervention at all. These studies will have to clearly distinguish objective measurements (such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc.) and subjective measurements (such as reports of pain or evaluative sensory observations by researchers, e.g., "I can see your tumor is smaller" or "I can see you are not as depressed as before").

            " was the work of Antonella Pollo et al. and demonstrated that placebos can help people with serious pain. The following is from their abstract:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p align="left">
             Thoracotomized patients were treated with
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buprenorphine">
              buprenorphine
             </a>
             Â [a powerful pain reliever] on request for 3 consecutive days, together with a basal intravenous infusion of saline solution. However, the symbolic meaning of this basal infusion was changed in three different groups of patients. The first group was told nothing about any analgesic effect (natural history). The second group was told that the basal infusion was either a powerful painkiller or a placebo (classic double-blind administration). The third group was told that the basal infusion was a potent painkiller (deceptive administration). Therefore, whereas the analgesic treatment was exactly the same in the three groups, the verbal instructions about the basal infusion differed. The placebo effect of the saline basal infusion was measured by recording the doses of buprenorphine requested over the three-days treatment. We found that the double-blind group showed a reduction of buprenorphine requests compared to the natural history group. However, this reduction was even larger in the deceptive administration group. Overall, after 3 days of placebo infusion, the first group received 11.55 mg of buprenorphine, the second group 9.15 mg, and the third group 7.65 mg. Despite these dose differences, analgesia was the same in the three groups. These results indicate that different verbal instructions about certain and uncertain expectations of analgesia produce different placebo analgesic effects, which in turn trigger a dramatic change of behaviour leading to a significant reduction of opioid intake.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p align="left">
            The patients who thought their IV contained a powerful pain reliever required 34% less of the analgesic than the patients who weren't told anything about their IV and 16% less than the patients who were told the IV could be either a powerful pain killer or a placebo. Each group got exactly the same amount of pain killer but their requests for the analgesic differed dramatically. The only significant difference among the three groups was the set of verbal instructions about the basal infusion. The study was too short for the differences to be explained by the natural history of recovery, regression, or any of the other alternatives found by Hrobjartsson and GÃ¶tzsche.
           </p>
           <p align="left">
            Several things are worth noting about this experiment. The setting involves treatment being provided by medical personnel in a medical facility. This kind of setting usually involves a strong desire for recovery or relief on the part of the patient, as well as a belief that the treatment will be effective. The different verbal instructions about the basal IV would lead to different expectations. Belief, motivation, and expectation are essential to the placebo effect.Â
            <a href="http://skepdic.com/conditioning.html">
             Classical conditioning
            </a>
            Â  and suggestion by an authoritative healer seem to be triggering mechanisms for the placebo effect (Bausell 2007: 131).
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           Crislip would probably not be impressed and note that subjective effects and conditioning are not placebos, even if everybody else doing research in this area thinks that they are.
          </p>
          <p>
           I also note in my entry on the placebo effect:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            Martina Amanzio et al. (2001) demonstrated that "at least part of the physiological basis for the placebo effect is opioid in nature" (Bausell 2007: 160). We can beÂ
            <a href="http://skepdic.com/conditioning.html">
             conditioned
            </a>
            Â to release such chemical substances as endorphins, catecholamines, cortisol, and adrenaline. One reason, therefore, that people report pain relief from both acupuncture and sham acupuncture is that both are placebos that stimulate the opioid system.
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           I assume Crislip is aware of Amanzio's work, but he doesn't mention it. In his responses to his critics on his website he seems to reject conditioning as having anything to do with the placebo effect.
          </p>
          <p>
           So, by defining the placebo effect in such a way as to exclude subjective perceptions, by ignoring studies that find objective effects from placebos, and by denying that conditioning is part of the placebo effect, Crislip is able to make his case. There is no placebo effect because he defines it in such a way as to exclude all the elements that others consider part of the placebo process.
          </p>
          <p>
           Researchers on this subject might be better off if they ignore Crislip and take their cue from a recent study published in the BMJ: "
           <a href="http://tinyurl.com/5cxlr7">
            Components of placebo effect: randomised controlled trial in patients with irritable bowel syndrome
           </a>
           ." The researchers tried to tease out the separate elements of the placebo effect. They look at three distinct components of a treatment: assessment and observation, a therapeutic ritual, and a supportive patient-practitioner relationship. It would not be surprising to find further research breaking down the effect into even smaller components. I don't think most researchers will agree with Crislip that there is no placebo effect, even if it turns out that no single component of the effect is sufficient to bring about the effect or that it is not necessary for all of the components to occur together. Nor will it matter that some of the components are also found in processes we don't usually associate with the placebo effect, such as cognitive behavioral therapy.

                with a placebo pill as a control specifically disclosed the 
                placebo content. Meanwhile 26.7% of trials involving injections 
                and procedures disclosed the precise nature of the treatment."

                         Placebo 
                Effects Revisited by Steven Novella
                        </a>
                        Existing evidence 
                strongly suggests that placebo effects are mostly comprised of 
                bias in reporting and observation and non-specific effects. 
                There is no measurable physiological benefit from placebo 
                interventions for any objective outcome. There is a measured 
                benefit for some subjective outcomes (mostly pain, nausea, 
                asthma, and phobias), but the wide variation in effect size 
                suggests this is due to trial design (and therefore bias) rather 
                than a real effect.

         Irritable Bowel Syndrome: Placebo Works Even if Patients Know
        </a>
        "Incredibly, according to a new study of patients with irritable bowel syndrome, the placebo effect, even when patients were in on the secret, worked almost as well as the leading medication on the market....After three weeks. the placebo group reported adequate symptom relief at double the rate of the group told to do nothing (59 percent vs. 35 percent). And those results are about as good as the leading irritable bowel syndrome drugs on the market. Researchers sounded the usual cautionary notes. The study was small. It's not clear what it would mean for other conditions and more research is needed."
       </p>
       <p>
        Even so, the study supports the notion that the leading IBS medication is a placebo.  Since many cases of IBS are stress-related, it makes sense that placebos would work well here if the process of administering them reduces stress. There's a lot the article doesn't cover.

         "There are limits to even the strongest placebo effect. 
    No simulation could set a broken arm, of course, or clear a blocked artery. 
    As a rule, placebos appear to affect symptoms rather than underlying 
    diseases--although sometimes, as in the case of depression or irritable 
    bowel syndrome, thereâs no meaningful distinction between the two. Moreover, 
    placebos have often received undue credit for recovery that might have 
    occurred anyway. Indeed, the effect is famously difficult to identify, 
    measure, and even coherently define. There is debate about the magnitude of 
    the response, with some calling it modest at best, and opposing the idea of 
    using placebos clinically."

    anti-depressants are placebos for all but the severely depressed. The 
    authors of the study concluded: the average benefit of antidepressant 
    medication in patients with mild or moderate symptoms of depression is 
    minimal. "The mere act of seeing a doctor, discussing symptoms and learning 
    about depression probably triggers the improvements many patients experience 
    while on medication."

    fresh clinical trial....For the recent analysis in the journal, the authors 
    identified 23 studies (out of several hundred clinical trials) that met

    only 6, with a total of 718 subjects....That is not many studies if your

      involved doing an fMRI of their spinal columns while applying different 
      degrees of heat to their arms, which had been treated with an analgesic or a 
      placebo. Some of these stories seem to think the study is groundbreaking 
      because it shows that the placebo effect is not all in the head. We already 
      knew that from numerous studies. Some claim that the study proves spinal 
      inhibition is one of the mechanisms by which the placebo effect reduces 
      pain. No, it doesn't. The study is too small to prove anything. It needs to 
      be replicated with larger groups and with some extensions to make sure the 
      fMRI readings are caused by the placebo and indicate what the researchers 
      think they indicate.

                  [The article is worth 
    reading but the blinking ad on the right might drive you away. Shrink your 
    viewing window to block out the annoying ad.] First, the facts: an 
    increasing number of new medications are unable to beat sugar pills in RCTs 
    (randomized control studies); trials done in different cultures get 
    different placebo responses; and those of us subjected to constant 
    advertising of pills for every ailment under the sun packaged with stories 
    from satisfied customers are being conditioned to expect relief for our 
    ailments from a pill. It is, of course, possible that the effectiveness of 
    new drugs versus placebos is decreasing because the clinical trials are 
    getting better or the new medications are less effective. There have been 
    studies that have found that certain persons are more susceptible to 
    placebos than others. What is intriguing is that there has been very little 
    study on the cultural influences that affect placebo response. More 
    intriguing is the role of cultural conditioning on susceptibility to placebo 
    effect. Though

    that through social conditioning more and more people could become more
