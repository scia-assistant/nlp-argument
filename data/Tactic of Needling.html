    <h2>
     Tactic of Needling
    </h2>
    <p>
     The Tactic of Needling occurs when one person tries to make another person angry rather than dealing with the issues being discussed. Needling can be used to play to the crowd or to prove something in the mind of the person doing the needling. It works like this. If I can get you to react in an inappropriate way, it makes you look like you are irrational and not to be trusted. On an emotional level, you feel convicted, the crowd knows your reaction was immature, and the person doing the needling feels superior to you, since they have not become angry.
    </p>
    <h2>
     Examples of the Tactic of Needling
    </h2>
    <p>
     Discussions on social media often give examples of this tactic in use. A contrarian position is taken using tricks that, to the average reader, would seem to be rational. Most fallacies seem to be rational when they are not. Another person is drawn into a debate format. The contrarian (troll) is practiced in needling and begins his or her work. Finally, the person who was drawn into the trap becomes angry and is embarrassed by his or her own lack of self-control.
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy begins to quietly poke at Sally in the back seat without actually touching her. Mom and Dad are in the front seat, totally unaware. Sally eventually whacks Billy. Dad sees that in the rear-view mirror and Sally gets disciplined. Billy gloats.

Everyone who uses this type of thinking must use presuppositions [things we make up and believe just because we want them to be true].
