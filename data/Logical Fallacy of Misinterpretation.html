    <h2>
     Logical Fallacy of Misinterpretation
    </h2>
    <p>
     The Logical Fallacy of Misinterpretation occurs when a statement is interpreted, but the interpretation was not what was meant. Many statements can be taken more than one way because of the nature of language. The way we can find out what something means is to ask the person what they mean by what they said. If the person is not available, then it is best to put the best construction on everything. People misinterpret the Bible. The best way to understand what God is saying through Scripture is to acknowledge His Presence and His Voice and to spend time in His Presence so that He can teach us. At any point in time, we don't know anything as we ought but are rather on an upward path where we are able to come to know Christ more completely as we stand in His Presence, yielding in respect and sincerity.
    </p>
    <h2>
     Examples of the Logical Fallacy of Misinterpretation
    </h2>
    <blockquote>
     <p>
      <span style="color: #ff0000;">
       "Wow! The Bible talks about motorcycles. Here in Joshua 6:27, it says that the noise of Joshua's triumph was heard throughout the land."
      </span>
     </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
     <span style="color: #008000;">
      While this is a humorous example, one of the main reasons for denominations is doctrinal differences. Most of these divergent and divisive doctrines are claimed to be based on Scripture. Yet, there is a place of interpretation and fallacy that causes differences. The Holy Spirit gives the interpretation to those who stand in God's Presence. If God is revealing, then He will be consistent. Sometimes, divisions are made based on semantics when the beliefs are identical or, at least, much closer than the two parties think.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span style="color: #000000;">
      The same evidence that is interpreted to "prove" the Big-Bang-Billions-of-Years-No-Flood-Molecules-to-Man story is also interpreted to "prove" the Creation-Flood account. The same Scriptures are used for both. Someone is not listening to the Holy Spirit. Someone is interpreting by rationalization. With a single assumption, the conclusion can land wherever you like.

Is it valid for the scoffer to accuse Christians of circular reasoning?  Note that this attack, in itself, is often an exhibition of poor logic.  Looking at this accusation a little more closely, we can see that the scoffers themselves use circular reasoning.  Every single one of them does.  They CANNOT avoid it.

Science and logic are limited and cannot show truth--scientists admit this.  With historical knowledge, scientific method CANNOT be applied directly, and circular reasoning is required.  In other words, you will end up proving whatever you set out to prove if you depend on observation, logic, and presuppositions.  Everyone who uses this type of thinking must use presuppositions [things we make up and believe just because we want them to be true].  And, how can we know about those things that we cannot observe such as the nature (or even existence or non-existence) of God or the definition of right and wrong?  There are three sources of supposed knowledge.  Only one of them is reliable. (click here to learn more)">
