## Project description (~400 words)

> This part should describe the project in plain English, by introducing the context and explaining the specificity of the project (why is it something new/interesting?).

The main objective of our project is to develop a tool that aids in the understanding of arguments, specifically by improving comprehension of the structure and content of a set of arguments.

To achieve this, we have two primary focuses:

- Detection of fallacious arguments using a large language model (LLM) combined with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. This feature will involve a chatbot capable of precisely categorizing fallacies, indicating their underlying basis, and providing sourced examples of similar arguments.
- Enhancing the logical reasoning abilities of an LLM through a logic-based language or library. This functionality can be divided into two sub-tasks:
	- Decomposing natural language sentences into basic logical elements.
	- Representing the logical structure of sentences or answering logical questions based on this structure.

> Describe a potential real-life use-case of your project.

A potential use case would be the analysis of political debates. Indeed, a tool capable of providing quick, detailed, and well-sourced analysis of arguments during a political debate could serve as a powerful aid for fact-checkers tasked with verifying the coherence and truthfulness of statements made by key political parties.

> Explain the challenge you want to solve.

Our ultimate objective is to improve existing LLMs in their ability to understand complex arguments. The challenge will be to handle very large sets of arguments, enabling the LLM to comprehend them with the help of RAG and logic tools at its disposal.

## Project background (~400 words)
	This part explores what has been done by other people in the line of work of the project from a technical / industrial / research point of view. Stress out how your project is different/similar to these other works.

## Project steps (Bullet points)
	This part lists the steps required to complete the project. It also explains how the work will be distributed across members. 

## First results (min. 200 words)
	This part presents the first results of the project. It can be negative results (“we made the whole pipeline and it does not work, we have errors X and problems Y”) or issues with a first version (“we made our application and it is slow / it does not solve problem X”). If your project is more R&D-like, it can be reproducing the results of a paper + a first experiment in the direction you would like to explore. Please include problems you faced with / are facing and ideas about how to tackle them.
